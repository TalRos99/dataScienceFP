# Project data
The entire dataset I'm using in this project is scraped from https://growdiaries.com/, as one of the largest weed-growing communities in the world, it holds a large amount of data. Each row represents a data point, and each column represents one of the diary features.
# Initial analysis and data refinement:

Trying to figure out which one of the dry/wet bud weights has the least null values and setting it as the target variable. 
After I looked for the number of null values in each feature and wrote it into a dictionary, that's the way to find out the features containing null and how many.
For other features besides germination, the median, different categories, or any rational method can be used. To figure out the germination, I will look for the unique values.As I see it, we have more null values than unique values so I'll drop it.
# A grower might not apply any growing technique so the null values will be replaced by zeros
Now that there are no null values in the data set, it is ready to convert it# EDA & Visualization
# The correlation between likes and comments is quite obvious. Later, I will use PCA to create new orthogonal basis vectors for it, to assess whether user engagement could lend credibility to a diary.# Outliers treatment
# Before removing bud wet weight outliers I desired my target vector would have values higher than 1. As I see it, less than 1 oz of harvest is really small growth# Following the previous question about user engagement, I am trying to find out if there is a direct correlation between the time and money invested in a diary and its popularity (for example, if all highly engaged diaries tend to contain plenty of nutrients of all types?)# Preforming PCA to likes and comments + Changing the indecies to diary_name
# Now we can perform supervised machine learning.We can see the model kind of predicts the trends but it lands quite far and having a hard time predicting the high values so I'll try with a smaller 'bud_wet_weight'.# There is no doubt that if we limit the target values, the model values will have less room for error.
# But I believe that the model is having trouble dealing with the picks, so if I had collected more data, the prediction would have been more accurate.
# More data would have allowed the model to detect patterns and trends in the data, which could have led to the model making more accurate predictions. Additionally, the increased data would have enabled us to fine-tune the model parameters to increase prediction accuracy.
